Why? Because we need to laugh as much as we need to learn And we get a lot of stress, so this helps kind of, like, eliminate a lot of it And it's healthy for you, laughter's the best medicine Welcome Mitch Hedberg Hey, How you doin', Berry Good to see ya, Good to see you After that Letterman stint, uh I saw you a couple times on Letterman right? Yeah, I just did it for the third time a couple days ago Third time? Yeah Now let's talk about this, let me Take me through your background Where you kinda grew up and And what age 12 was your first Appearance in uh, on stage? I— Oh, on stage. Yeah, I was gonna say I appeared at zero, but, you know My first stage appearance was twelve, Man, but uh You know, when you were doin' that thing At the beginning at the show where You were talkin' about my story man It sounded, way more inspirational than I ever thought it was man I kinda got tears in my eye for a minute There I realized things are going pretty Good for me Well— you accomplished a lot You were—talk about when you were A cook for years, and, and How you made the transition Well, I used to be infatuated with The grill when I was a busboy I would watch these guys cook And you know, I finally achieved My dream of becoming a cook Which was really easy 'cause all I had to do was tell the manager ""Hey man, do you mind if I cook?"" And he said yeah, you know It was easy to achieve that dream And— (Laughs) No, no, that's really a good point Is that cool? But Yeah But, so I, I che— I actually thought You know cooking what, might be what I wanted to do for a while you know But then uh— since like you said at twelve I star— I was performing, I was acting a lot like uh We would take uh We would copy Saturday Night Live Skits and SCTV You know that show (yes, yes) Yeah man likeBob and Doug McKenzie Remember them characters? (Hmm) They had that great movie calledStrange Brew But we would just copy those skits And we would make our friends laugh And hey of course, there's nothing like Standing in front of uh People and making them laugh As long as you're trying to You know, I mean if they're laughing At you for the wrong reasons It kind of sucks (Laughs) But its okay Now this was in your basement Or was it with your Neighborhood friends right? Yeah, yeah in my parents' basement 'Cause my parents were the ones who Would always let the kids come over And mess up the house for the day And uh we would put on these skits And everyone was talented but Now no one does anything in the Talent industry except me I'm the only one who survived though the Years man, through the lean years You know they all gave it up when times Got tough they were like 15 and they said ""No more of this"" You know Tell me about that because every time I had, you know, you hadDon Rickles we had on we had uhh Different comedians from all different Backgrounds and they had many years Of adversity where they were not Making it they were getting rejected (Right) Why is that important to go Through that and what did you learn? Oh 'cause it it builds you, you know It— It makes your skin tough, you know And uh rejection is— is real tough at first But after a while you kind of thrive on it It's an energy in itself just to get rejected Talk about that Well 'cause you want— you want to Prove people that you know, they're Wrong man Like, like when I first started doing Comedy people would try to tell me How to dress and they would try to Tell me, kind of— What kind of jokes to do And they wanted me to go to like a— A standup comedy class and have Some other guy tell me how to be funny You know man (Hmm) And funny is natural, you know You don't— you can't learn How to be funny you know You can learn how to say a joke in A certain rhythm but you can't learn How to be funny and I knew that But these people were trying to tell me You got to come to class and we'll tell You how to present yourself And everything and all that so So— Go ahead So believing inside not letting Them trying to change the outside of you Right, right because this one lady At one point she gave me advice I got a lot of advice in the early days Of my comedy And one lady told me to wear A lot of jewelry on stage, you know 'Cause she thought like I wanted to attract The crowd, you know Just with my jewelry, you know They be so— they' be so excited that I had this like broche on or something They forget that I'm funny, you know 'Cause a lot— a lot of advice comes from People who aren't very funny They have they've adapted ways To like, remain working because They're real professional They always wear a suit and tie, you know (Hmm) So— so a lot of advice I was getting was From comics who weren't that good in it I never could take it You know what I'm saying? (Hmm) I know that I had like a— A different thing to say to him so I— I had to chill out and just ride out The bad times like that So but the— but you talk about Rejection being able to take what makes You stronger proving other people wrong That's the real important point A lot of people, that devastates them Yeah yeah yeah Have you every had a situation Where you just bombed? Where I bombed on stage? (Hmm) Oh many situations man Pluralize that immediately because I— I bombed endlessly, you know I use to tour Montana and Idaho And uh Oregon to these one nighter bars I'd go from bar to bar and I'd be the Opening actor of a two man show And the guy going on last would Always kill I would always bomb horribly Then the next guy would go on and he'd Have a lot of jokes about like genitalia And such which the crowds kind of Wanted to hear they like that stuff But I didn't have any of those jokes so I was bombing But the only good thing about that was Is a lot of times These towns would be loaded with Kind of like, scary looking women and— And the scary looking women would Always ask the funnier guy to dance So I never had to dance you cool There's always something good And something bad right? Yea, I just had to sit down 'Cause no they were too they didn't like Me 'cause I wasn't funny so They didn't want to dance with me Yeah so Now now now That adversity helped you I mean that's rejection That's falling it helps you kind of Come back stronger Do you focus do you learn Something from that? Oh uh Well you just learn that you got to Get the hell out of here and find Your right—you got to find Your audience man That adversity is like You got to keep searching for Your audience is what it does It just makes you search harder is What it does That's good Yeah When we come back I want to talk to you about about uh You know why you believe that Jumping in even though maybe You're not 100% prepared is More important than preparing And never doing anything obviously Oh it's so true man, yeah You got to like uh Learn while doing right?

Are these my own thoughts, or is it just the dope talkin'? I've learned about life through love So, how do we inform those of us who have never felt the touch of a goddess when she vulnerable? I'm givin' my condolence to you If you never felt that feelin', I just hope that you do It's somethin' kind of hard to comprehend, when your life on the end I leave things behind that always slip my mind Because my mind is always elsewhere I guess I feel myself there, a place where space is erased, I never felt scared That's why givin' up feel satisfying Didn't have to try to turn the water back to wine The impossible is tempting, as an areola when it's there, never haven't felt aware It's hard to breathe when you care, the moment I was drowning, you were coming up for air (Air) I wish that I could make you understand, I just want to see my mother dance If I fuck it up, I'm prayin' for another chance You could never feel euphoria as lovers can (Lovers can) I fuckin' am, I said I fuckin' am gone"

“Watch Movies With the Sound Off” Review,Unknown,"Before I start and jump into this review I want to inform you that I wasn't a Mac Miller fan before this album dropped. Mac Miller while being one of the most successful indie hip hop artists ever, lyrically he just didn't do it for me. He just kind of reminded me of everything I wasn't really feeling about mainstream hip hop these days. Then about a month or so before the release of his sophomore effort “Watching Movies With the Sound Off” he released a couple joints before that. My ears didn't really perk up to listen until I heard “The End Is Near” first because Ab-Soul is on it, second Mac produced the joint and thirdly lyrically Mac Miller had stepped his game up. I wasn't entirely sold but I was intrigued. Next day the video for “S.D.S” came out produced by FlyLo. Mac Miller once again came correct. Lastly I saw the tracklisting and guest features on this album and I knew I had to cop it. Let's see if “WMWTSO” was enough to transform me into a fan As I stated before I wasn't too keen on Mac Miller's catalog before this, however once this album starts it immediately grabbed my attention from the beat and the dark lyrics. “The Star Room” is the first track on the album and it's filled with a Mac reflecting on his life and how it's changing. His new found success isn't all glory, glamour and fun times and it's evident this is causing him frustration. Everything from love, to drugs is covered in this song and it's a breathe of fresh air to hear from him A couple tracks later we get “I Am Not Real” which features Earl Sweatshirt (unfortunately only in the form of a hook) but the darkness continues on this joint. Like in “The Star Room” Mac Miller talks about more specifically about the all the bad sides about the fame that he's garnered over the years. Gold diggers, fake friends considered acquaintances, pain, drugs and more. Hearing Mac take us into the other not so glamorous side of the music business. Mac is searching for answers to a lot of questions in this album in general and he's bringing us along for his journey through life “I Am Who I Am (Killing Time)” has Mac Miller questioning being famous but this also questioning God and religion. He feels like God has blessed by becoming famous however at the same time he wonders why God gave it to him if he's sinning. He questions those who judge him for buying material things with the money that he's making now. He feels that he almost wasting away in the studio because he spends so much time in there. The second verse takes an even darker turn with the content Forfeit in the war, he lays a sword down and walks away Grabs a 40 from the corner store and begins to contemplate Dealing with death like you work in the morgue aborsving the souls Forgotten, he lost his way Starring down that barrel, thinking not today Now I'll be honest the middle of the album kind of falls off a little bit for me because he seemingly goes back to the old Mac Miller that I wasn't a fan off. With songs like “Red Dot Music” (with Action Bronson ), “Gees” (with ScHoolboy Q ) and “Watching Movies” old fans of Mac will be pleased to see that he is in original form here and I think that's a good thing for fans to see. There's definitely maturity on this album but he sticks to his roots too “REMember” is one of my favorite songs on the record where Mac Miller is paying homage to a fallen friend. The first verse has him talking to his friend wishing he would come back. A strong line has Mac wishing his friend had a kid so Mac could tell him/her stories about their would be father. The second first has Mac Miller telling people not to take life for granted because it can be taken from you at any moment so cherish it The questioning of all of life's most difficult questions continues with “Aquarium” . The first verse mostly is about religion and his wanting to search for a deeper purpose in his life than what he's managing now: ""I'll always wonder what happened 3000 years ago I like to toy with the idea that we really know Is what I do important in the grand scheme of things? In my head these dreams are dreamt, trust me we are kings” The second verse is the continued questioning on life's purpose and even brings the idea that in America it almost seems like our purpose is to make money and gaining knowledge. Throughout the entire record we're witnessing a 21 year old man question the world around him from everything he's given, to everything he's earned over the years “WMWTSO” is easily Mac Miller's best effort. One part that I skipped on the album was its production which was extremely solid. One part that I see being overlooked is how well Larry Fisherman's (aka Mac Miller) beats were on this album. This album shows that he's really put in the work on the production side of his game. Even as a whole the guest producers on the album were solid and created a cohesive sounding album (the only beat I thought that didn't really fit in was “S.D.S” but even that doesn't matter because the beat was straight fire). Lyrically Mac Miller puts everything on the line, he's questioning a lot of things and dealing with a lot of pain too For fans of Mac Miller you might not like the change his underwent as of late, but assuming that you're fans of anyone that's featured on the project you should enjoy what Mac Miller is offering with “WMWTSO” . All the features are on point and the diversity on this project whether it be production or lyrics is good to hear from him. I am officially a Mac Miller fan, “Born Sinner” and “Yeezus” may have come out on the same day but don't sleep on this album. What ever box you had Mac Miller in before this release I can guarantee you that he breaks that box wide open during this entire album"
